# transfer-courses-wustl
A redesign of Washington University in St. Louis's delivery of transfer-course information using Python & PostgreSQL

Collaborators: Ali Axelrod, Davis Lutwack, Kristen Wilder

### Overview
* Originally, when looking for a summer course, students had to search through hundreds of unorganized schools and thousands of courses that would be accepted by WashU
* With this project students can now easily search for schools and courses by zip code

### Getting started
* clone this repository
* `cd transfer-courses-wustl `
* `pip install psycopg2`
* To find schools near you: `python find_schools.py`
* To find courses near you: `python find_courses.py`
